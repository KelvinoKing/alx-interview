# 0x03. Log Parsing

This project aims to develop a Python script for parsing and processing log data from standard input (stdin). The script will read log entries line by line, compute various metrics, and print statistics based on the input data.

## Algorithm

- **Language:** Python
- **Weight:** 1
- **Start Date:** Mar 25, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Deadline:** Apr 1, 2024 6:00 AM

## Overview

For the "0x03. Log Parsing" project, you will apply your Python programming skills to parse and process data streams in real-time. The script will read from standard input, handle data in a specific format, and perform calculations based on the input data. The project involves concepts such as file I/O, signal handling, data processing, regular expressions, dictionaries, and exception handling.

## Tasks

### Log Parsing

- **Score:** 0.0%
- **Checks Completed:** 0.0%
- **Description:** Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics based on the input log data. After every 10 lines or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), print statistics including total file size and number of lines by status code.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alx-interview/0x03-log_parsing.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x03-log_parsing
   ```

## Usage

1. Generate log data using the provided script:

   ```bash
   ./0-generator.py | ./0-stats.py
   ```

2. View the computed statistics based on the generated log data.
